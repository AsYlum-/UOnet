Known Issues:
Currently wrapped dll fails in vs2010 debug mode, client variables come back null and CliNr keeps reseting to 0.
Build your app then run directly via exe for no issues. It does not appear to be a UAC type error as disabling UAC and also running vs2010 as admin give
the same results.

VS2011 Beta running under Windows 8 does not have the above problem, debug mode works fine.
